Face recognition is a computer vision task of identifying and verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source.
It is typically used in security systems and can be used to identify individuals in photos, videos, or in real-time.

To implement face recognition in Python, you can use a library called face_recognition.
This library, developed by Adam Geitgey, uses machine learning to recognize faces in images. Here is an example of how to use it:

This code will load an image file, detect any faces in the image, and print the number of faces it found.
You can then use the face locations to draw a box around the face or do other processing on the faces in the image.
"""
# Import the face_recognition library
import face_recognition

# Load the image of the person you want to recognize
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("person.jpg")

# Use the face_recognition library to find the faces in the image
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)



# Print the results
print("I found {} face(s) in this photograph.".format(len(face_locations)))
